# waterquality

Nowadays, water pollution has impacted on the ecology and human existence and it has become a global issue. Besides that, due to human or industrial activity, the water resources are progressively becoming polluted and unavailable. Water pollution occurs when pollutants are discharged into bodies of water, either indirectly or directly and without proper treatment to remove the dangerous sediment. One of the most serious environmental issues confronting mankind today is the rising pollution of freshwater systems with hundreds of industrial and natural chemical substances being leaked into the water. Water quality is currently determined through costly and time-consuming lab and statistical analyses, which necessitate sample collection, transportation to labs, and a significant amount of time and calculation. This is ineffective, given that water is a highly communicable medium, and time is of the essence if water is contaminated with disease-causing waste. Water quality testing is an important part of environmental monitoring. If the water quality is poor, it will not only affect aquatic life but the surrounding ecosystem as well
